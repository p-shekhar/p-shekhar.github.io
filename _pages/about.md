I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Department of Mathematics at <a href="https://erau.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="color:SteelBlue">Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)</span></a>. My research interests are in theoretical foundations of explainable machine learning, transfer learning, computer vision, natural language processing and AI in general. I am also interested in applications of AI to noisy data modeling, healthcare, engineering and environmental science. 
Before joining ERAU, I was a data scientist at <a href="https://disc.tufts.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="color:SteelBlue">Data Intensive Studies Center (DISC)</span></a> at Tufts University for 2 years.
