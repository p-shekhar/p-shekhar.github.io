I am an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Department of Mathematics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU). My research interests are in explainable machine learning, transfer learning, computer vision, natural language processing and AI in general. I am also interested in applications of AI to noisy data modeling, medical imaging, manufacturing and engineering. 
Before joining ERAU, I was a data scientist at Data Intesive Studies Center at Tufts University for 2 years.
